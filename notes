ToDo:
- Understand JSON-API v1 https://jsonapi.org/ build with Graphiti https://graphiti-api.github.io/graphiti/guides/
- Create UPB Adapter
	Ideally in same language as RPI i.e. Rails https://graphiti-api.github.io/graphiti/quickstart
	but perhaps also could use python i.e. https://github.com/socialwifi/jsonapi-requests/
	
	For Rails Attempt:
	- create virtualenvwrapper for yacsvf
	- follow graphiti quickstart guide

- Configure Amalgamator for UPB Adapter
